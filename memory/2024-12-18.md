# 2024-12-18 - KukuWorld Development Progress

## Today's Work Summary
Today I focused on implementing several core systems for the KukuWorld game:

1. Created EnemyController.cs - Handles enemy behavior, movement, combat, and death logic
2. Created BuildingManager.cs - Manages all building instances, construction, upgrades, and functionality
3. Created KukuCollectionSystem.cs - Handles KuKu collection, storage, naming, and management
4. Created FusionSystem.cs - Implements fusion mechanics for various combinations

## Key Features Implemented

### EnemyController
- Health, speed, and damage management
- Target navigation system for attacking guardian points
- Debuff application (slow effects)
- Death handling with item drops
- Visual feedback for health and status

### BuildingManager
- Construction queue management
- Building placement validation
- Production queues for units
- Phase-specific activation (capture vs defense)
- Building type-specific logic (towers, production, research, etc.)

### KukuCollectionSystem
- Dynamic KuKu generation with names, attributes, and rarities
- Collection and storage mechanisms
- Pokedex functionality
- Team management
- Rarity-based attribute scaling

### FusionSystem
- Multiple fusion types (KuKu-Robot, Robot-Robot, KuKu-KuKu)
- Equipment slot allocation based on fusion type
- Success rate calculation
- Evolution mechanics
- Resource cost management

## Technical Notes
- All systems integrate properly with GameManager and PlayerData
- Proper resource management and validation checks implemented
- Visual feedback systems included where appropriate
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Flexible design allows for easy expansion

## Next Steps
- Implement weapon system and equipment management
- Add more specific building types and functionalities
- Expand fusion recipes and special combinations
- Implement save/load functionality
- Add more detailed combat mechanics
